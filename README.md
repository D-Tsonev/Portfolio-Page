# Pordfolio Page HTML CSS Git 

## Overview 

My task was to optimise a webpage which must meet accessibility standards. 

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title


This challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: **accessibility**. 


## The Technologies used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Git and GitHub**
- **Web Accessability Evaluation Tool**

**Important**: An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the **Scout Rule**, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.
